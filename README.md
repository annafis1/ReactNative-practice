# Basic React Native practice
This app consists of several basics of react native front-end practice
for my own self-improvement.

Things I have learned so far:
- Navigating between screens using bottom tab and drawer
- Data rendering with Map
- Passing data(s) between screens
- State life cycle
- Styling
- Make a custom drawer
- Update local json data

Some youtube reference I watched:
- [React native setup](https://youtu.be/4j_m_T0u8xU)
- [React native navigation tutorial (from basic stack to drawer)](https://youtu.be/a9jSyZXYGn8?list=PLQWFhX-gwJbmmqcP-9zMXBaxQbGKfIJY2)
