# Basic React Native practice
This app consists of several practice for me to get used to react-native for my
own self-improvement.
<br>
<br>
Things I have learned so far:
- Navigating between screens using bottom tab and drawer
- Data rendering with Map
- Passing data(s) between screens
- State life cycle
- Styling
- Make a custom drawer

Some youtube reference I watched:
- [React native setup](https://youtu.be/4j_m_T0u8xU)
- [React native navigation tutorial (from basic stack to drawer)](https://youtu.be/a9jSyZXYGn8?list=PLQWFhX-gwJbmmqcP-9zMXBaxQbGKfIJY2)
